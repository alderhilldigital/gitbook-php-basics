# $\_GET

Contains all variables sent via a HTTP GET request. For example, a URL of myfile.php?name=Paul would load myfile.php and give you $\_GET\["name"\] with the value "Paul". 

Users of older PHP versions will have used $HTTP\_GET\_VARS array, which, although deprecated, is still available for use.
